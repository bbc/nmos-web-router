### Contributor Licence Agreement

We desire that contributors of pull requests have signed, and submitted via email, an [Individual Contributor Licence Agreement][ICLA] (ICLA) (PDF version [here][ICLA-pdf]), which is based on the [Apache ICLA][Apache-ICLA].

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the BBC and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time.

If you haven't signed and emailed the agreement yet then the project owners will contact you using the contact info with the pull request.

  * We may in the future use a tool that allows you to sign online through your GitHub id and automatically checks this when you submit a pull request.
